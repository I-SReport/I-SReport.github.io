ISSAQUAH & SAMMAMISH—The Issaquah School District is now finishing up their yearly state mandated standardized testing. The testing schedule, elegantly placed right between AP and IB testing and the student’s finals, ensures minimized stress as students do not have to worry about communicating with their teachers or learning in class. Along with this, the school meets their minute requirements for student class time by elegantly shoving the remaining guts of the 7 class periods into 17 minute segments at the end of the day. This form of scheduling ensures that there is an optimal chance that all students attend all classes.

Along with the scheduling, the results from the test are very important, if the Issaquah School District is ever to be able to dig itself out of the $15 million hold of debt it has landed itself in without renting out its half-unused $15 million office building, it has to hope for smarter kids and better test scores. Along with this, realtors are feeling the pressure, as the amount of money they are able to sell their houses for depends on the results of the test which none of the students put any effort into. Real Estate agent Ted Kzusiks describes his situation as such: “If these [explicative] rentoid children don’t do well on those [explicative] tests, I will personally have a word and a .22 caliber shotgun with them.”
