SAMMAMISH—The International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) recently announced drastic changes to the IB Diploma Path (IBDP). In the announcement, the IBO expressed unequivocal disapproval of the current curriculum, stating that said curriculum “does not cultivate students’ abilities to a satisfactory degree.” These changes are set to take effect in 2023 and will NOT affect current IBDP students, with some exceptions.

The current IBDP curriculum requires candidates to take at least one test from each IB-defined group. For instance, an IB Diploma candidate must take at least one test from the following groups: Language (English), Language (Foreign), Individuals & Societies, Sciences, and Mathematics. In total, a candidate should have six total tests. Within these six tests, a student may choose to take either four higher-level (HL) and two standard-level (SL) tests or three higher-level and three standard-level tests.

The IBO plans to drastically change the testing requirements. Instead of requiring six total tests, the IBO will require seven. Out of these seven, at least five tests must be HL tests. In addition to the tests, the IBO will mandate a required competency test in Latin for ALL IB students in the class of 2024 or after. Said candidate must score at least ninety-eight out of hundred marks to pass.

The IBO plans to enact sweeping reforms not only to its diploma path but also to its curriculum. In a recent press conference, the director of the IBO verbalized concerns with the difficulty of IB courses, mentioning that “[an] increase [in difficulty] is inevitable.” These changes could manifest as either an extended curriculum for IB classes or stricter grading criteria for internal assessments. Although we do not have access to every proposed change, we have access to the proposed changes for IB Computer Science SL. Since its inception, IB Computer Science SL has utilized an obscure programming language called Java. However, the IBO has now declared that the programming language taught in all IB Computer Science courses will change from Java to Fortran, an indubitably more pragmatic language.

These changes mark the beginning of an era in the IB saga that will entail the instruction of a rigorous, applicable curriculum. IB diploma graduates will transform into engaged, brilliant learners, possessing unequivocally practical skills, from fluency in Latin to advanced knowledge of Fortran.

Thus concludes my essay~.~
