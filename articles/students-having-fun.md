SAMMAMISH—Tragedy struck at Skyline High School on November 29th, as a group of currently anonymous students was spotted having fun in front of the school. Due to this public display of such a dangerous activity, the administration filed a police report.

Experts state that the weather may have a part to play in this. According to the administrator who witnessed the event, the students had started a “friendly” snowball fight before dispersing after being called out. “We cannot and will not tolerate such acts,” stated Admin. “The perpetrators are a danger to the ethics of this institution.”

With more snowfall coming, similar events will occur frequently. The Sammamish Police Department has issued a warning about such activity. It instructs all readers to run, hide, or fight when viewing a manifestation of student joy. Moreover, the department asserted that the local police will respond with quick and decisive action against those who do such a risky activity.

In the meantime, Skyline High School and all other Issaquah School District high schools have decided to salt all areas of the school and require a complete search of all students entering school campuses. These measures are part of a new program to reduce the chances of another event. The Sammamish Police Department verbalized, “To those who have committed this atrocity, we will find you, and bring you to justice.”
