ISSAQUAH—The Issaquah School District has recently announced their winner for the “Most Moral Non-Profit” award, with College Board winning the title, along with a $5 million prize. College Board stated that they may be able to use this money, along with the tax-exempt $32 million they make in revenue each year[^\[1\]^](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/display_audit/1060820211) as a non-profit, to reduce some of the cost of AP tests. “Our executives have graciously decided to take the cut to their paychecks to reduce the cost,” they said in a statement to _The Issaquah-Sammamish Report_.

The College Board has profited off the futures of High Schoolers for over 120 years. It has been helping students ever since its creation by providing access to tests such as the SAT created by Carl C. Brigham, who was a member of the American Eugenics Society and eventually progressed to working on its Advisory Council[^\[2\]^](https://ia801305.us.archive.org/25/items/AMERICANEUGENICSSOCIETYMEMBERS/AMERICAN%20EUGENICS%20SOCIETY%20MEMBERS.pdf). College Board also provides college-level courses in many important disciplines such as:

- AP Art History
- AP Art and Design
- AP Comparative Government and Politics
- AP European History
- AP Human Geography
- AP Spanish Language and Culture
- AP Spanish Literature and Culture

Moreover, the College Board provides a rigorous, detailed curriculum concerning contemporary facets of life and work. The classes exemplifying this fact are the following:

- AP Latin
- AP Research
- AP Seminar
- AP Music Theory

Unfortunately however, they are unable to cover all subjects, as AP classes for obscure languages such as Hindi and Russian are not offered.

However, it was not a clear-cut victory for College Board, as they had another major contender in their way, the International Baccalaureate (IB) Organization. IB also similarly runs its organization, pressing students with challenging courses with no breaks. The breakneck pace may be hard for some; however, this cost is offset by the benefit of having the same or even fewer benefits of AP courses while putting in more effort.

The only thing that was able to hold IB back from attaining their perhaps rightfully deserved title was their lack of direct revenue. IB makes a bit less than a measly $500 thousand each year from their high school students, which was a major factor in the final decision according to the Issaquah School District.

Many speculate on what these changes may bring to us in the future, however, it appears to be that neither organization plans to change any time soon “our system works for us, what needs to change?” IB said after we asked them for a statement “the future of high school students is just another source of capital which one must tap into”.
