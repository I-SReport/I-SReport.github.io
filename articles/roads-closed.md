ISSAQUAH & SAMMAMISH—With the holiday seasons coming in full swing, the cities of Issaquah and Sammamish are both working hard to recover from the damage left by the recent snowfall on the roads around the town. Recently, they have announced their solution to the issues in their roadway systems.

“A Christmas miracle” is what experts are saying is the ingenious solution to deteriorating roadway conditions. This Christmas Eve, both cities will close all roads for repairs for three days as a “gift to all those driving.” Experts state that this new strategy will “decrease traffic significantly on Christmas Eve and Christmas day when most drivers will be out.” They also claim that “this \[strategy\] is guaranteed to reduce, if not completely remove, the chance of pedestrian accidents”.

After consulting with experts more on pedestrian safety, both cities decided to close their roads. “Our goal is safe, efficient, and, most importantly, convenient transportation for everyone in the Issaquah and Sammamish areas.” Their joint statement declared three days ago, “We hope you understand our decisions and wish you all happy holidays with your family”.

With this new information and rapidly-approaching town hall meetings, many are excited to see the aftermath of such a drastic change. The issue itself is already divisive among the people unfortunate enough to keep up with local politics; the top-ranked competitive drama viewers are awaiting the inevitable “bloodbath.”
