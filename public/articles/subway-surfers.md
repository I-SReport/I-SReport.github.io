UNITED STATES—The Department of Education has released a new teaching guideline for all schools to abide by following recent ground-breaking research. These new mandates were recently added into the Fundamental United Classroom Code § 8008.E.15, which states the following:

```
Section 8008.E.15. DISPLAY OF SUBWAY SURFERS® GAMEPLAY. (a) A public school must display in a conspicuous place in each classroom of the school a durable monitor or projection of Subway Surfers® gameplay that meets the requirements of Subsection (b).
    (b) Requires that a monitor or projection of Subway Surfers® gameplay described by Subsection (a)
    (1) include a consistent loop of at least 10 minutes of uninterrupted Subway Surfers® gameplay. Visible to a person with average vision from anywhere in the classroom.
    (2) have a 16:9 ratio with at least a 12” monitor
  (c) Requires the gameplay of the monitor or projection of the Subway Surfers® gameplay described by Subsection (a) to be of a certain form. Sets for the form required to be included on the display.
  (d) Requires a public school in which each classroom does not include a monitor or projection of the Subway Surfers® gameplay as required by Subsection (a) to:
    (1) accept any offer of a privately donated monitor, projector, or gameplay footage of Subway Surfers® gameplay provided that it:
      (A) meets the requirements of Subsection (b); and
      (B) does not contain any additional content; and
    (2) display the monitor, projection, or Subway Surfers® gameplay as specified in Subsection (a).
  (e) Authorizes the school, if a public school has a monitor or projection of Subway Surfers® gameplay in each classroom that does not meet the requirements of Subsection (b), to replace the monitors or projections with monitors or projections that meet the requirements of Subsection (b) using public funds or by accepting a private donation.
  (f) Requires a public school to offer a monitor of projection of Subway Surfers® gameplay described by Subsection (a) in the school’s possession that is not needed for display in a classroom as a donation to another public elementary or secondary school.

The Department of Education states that “we have noted that through our research that when Subway Surfers® gameplay is presented to a classroom, have an increase of at least 50% to the attention span of students, and at least a 75% increase in the knowledge retention of any given student.” Due to these recent findings, the law is to come into effect in the coming 2023-2024 school year. “We want to implement these findings to improve the lives of students everywhere” stated the Department of Education at a press conference.

However, there are some opposed to the new act. Some, like Anthony Bekner, state that, “The law, in its current state, is completely and utterly totalitarian. I cannot believe that any such law has even been taken into consideration.” When asked for a comment, the Department of Defense responded by reminding him of the fact that he lives in Texas[^\[1\]^](https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/88R/analysis/html/SB01515I.htm). Another group, Moms for Liberty, states that, “The promotion of criminal activity in classrooms through the display of Subway Surfers® gameplay, which promotes vandalism and resistance to arrest should be completely stricken and censored.” Moms for Liberty is slowly gaining traction in the south, and it seems as though there are many more legal challenges for this law coming ahead.
