ISSAQUAH—Local Secretary of Transportation, in Coordination with the Issaquah City Police Department, has stated that they will now be setting the speed limit in the local section of I-90 to 5 miles per hour.

“We are running behind our quotas,” the head of the Police Department states, “not even our most well-designed speed traps are helping us cut it anymore.” Experts hope this will allow the dream of local quotas for police to continue to live on; however, they warn of an increased risk of crashing associated with the change. “We may or may not be experiencing a small amount of slightly increased risk of collisions of varying degrees. Perhaps, we may still need to run a few more collision simulations with partial changes in weather, I think,” traffic expert John Brayan Adam states.

Local transportation companies ensure that delivery schedules will not change, “we see the recent developments in this situation and assure you that we will continue to run as usual,” one spokesperson stated. It appears they will pay to allow the speed limit to not apply to company vehicles. Local representatives refused to provide a comment to _The Issaquah-Sammamish Report_ but stated that “it isn’t bribery” when we provided a $15 gift card.

However, some people are against such a change: they view the decline in traffic tickets as a way to finally kill the quota system. “Why should we not celebrate this decrease in traffic violations?” said a man during a recent town hall meeting. This sentiment appeared to echo across the people of Issaquah, and it seems as though the debate over the new speed limit may rage on until the next issue comes up.
