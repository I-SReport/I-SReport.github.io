ISSAQUAH—Recently, the Issaquah School District School Board announced that they will receive bonuses for their work using the Prop. 2 Capital Levy. They have used 40% of the money in the levy for its intended purpose. For their work in this, they shall be assigned the remaining 60% as bonuses to themselves.

The Prop. 2 Capital Levy was an integral tax levy filed by the Issaquah School District this year. It designated $53.8 million for one-to-one technology for all students, which has been well received. “I don’t think they even qualify as modern technology,” Bryan Kudros, a Sophomore from Skyline High School, stated, who agreed to give their statement as long as they remained anonymous. The levy also allowed for the renovation of schools; however, it appears that they will instead use it to build a new school for more underpaid teachers that “nobody asked for,” according to Susanna Kurdos, who lives at 3452 Bussaun Way, Sammamish, Washington 98073.

Through these, the Issaquah School district has burned through $21.52 million, with $1.32 million assigned to one-to-one computers, and the remaining money given to the construction of the new high school. With a job well done, the five people on the Issaquah School District School Board are to divide the remaining $32.28 million among themselves. “We see no problem with this use of our funds,” the Director of the School Board stated, “when the teachers do a good job of teaching the students, they can get their bonuses.”

However, it is not all smooth sailing for the School Board, as recent opposition has come up. Many are questioning the legality of this move, “we voted for the students, not for you” is a common catchphrase among those protesting the recent redistribution of funds. Even though there is “great opposition” to the actions of the School Board, the Board stated that “we have not seen anyone voice their opinions against us, and if they come, we are ready,” one of the Board members declared “to cut them off.”

These actions by the School Board are indicative of the monetary policy of the Issaquah School District in general, and many people, for or against it, are aware of this. The battle over these bonuses may be a case of a shift in rhetoric against the Issaquah School District School board and their monetary policy over the years.
