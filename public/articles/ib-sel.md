SAMMAMISHâ€”The International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) has recently come under fire for neglecting the mental health of the students in their IB Diploma Path (IBDP) and IB Career Path (IBCP) programs. Attempting to escape this criticism, they announced they are introducing a new course to their IB roster, IB Social Emotional Learning (SEL).

The goal of IB SEL is to teach the students the core ideas of how to deal with their mental health through a series of presentations. Tips include "use your free time wisely," "take frequent walks," and "be grateful." Schools will mandate the presentations for all students to ensure that nobody falls behind. All students must fill out a quiz on the material afterward, and they will have to review the presentation during a designated time later to rewatch the presentation. "Such efficiency is lacking in the academic timetables of this time," said the IBO director "we expect to use the dearth of structure within the free time of the pupils and use it for a renewed, more illustrious embodiment of efficacy."

Due to many IBDP and IBCP students having already filled schedules, the IBO has decided to direct schools to use Flex times to display their presentations. However, this would mean that students outside these programs would have free time during Flex. To fix this issue, the IBO has stated that all high school students must engage with the IB SEL program during Flex.

The IBO has also confirmed plans for an IB SEL test, a requirement for all IBDP and IBCP students. This examination will be a Paper 3, with prompts covering various topics discussed throughout the previous school years. The IBO states that this is to help them gauge the efficacy of their solution by using the exam results to confirm their understanding of the topics and advice they have presented. "We are looking forward to this new change," states the Issaquah School District "we believe that the steps that the IBO are taking are the future of student mental health education."
