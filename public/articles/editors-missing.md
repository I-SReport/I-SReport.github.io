_The Issaquah-Sammamish Report_ Office Building—Panic erupted at the office of _The Issaquah-Sammamish Report_ this morning as it appears that the editors for our publication have finally escaped the basement. We are currently looking for their whereabouts. We are unsure what their reason for escape may be, as they have not had any decreases in their bean-per-word wage due to the recent economic downturn. They also have unparalleled job security, being employed for the rest of their (reportedly short) lives. If you wish to apply to help us continue to publish articles, contact us.

If you see any of the following people, contact _The Issaquah-Sammamish Report_ immediately:
