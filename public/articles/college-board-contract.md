UNITED STATES—On Friday, May 12th, the College Board, an educational nonprofit dedicated to the management of various forms of standardized testing, announced that it would require prospective AP students to sign up for their classes roughly eleven years before the fact. This is part of the College Board’s “Determined Future,” a plan in which they aim to instill resounding certainty of the future in preschoolers.

Journalist Harry Pete Ness of _The Issaquah-Sammamish Report_ met with CEO Venkatesh Chimodhyan Branadh of the College Board to discuss the provisions of the new initiative. When asked about its goal, Branadh responded “We want students to know exactly what will happen.” Branadh further elaborated on this, stating that he plans to institute a binding, irreversible contract that dictates the classes a prospective AP student will take once in high school. Branadh also mentioned that the contract determines SAT score of the student, which is deduced by subtracting the emotional quotient of the student from their intelligence quotient and multiplying it by a scale factor. According to Branadh, this ensures that only the most relevant and practical brain components comprise the score that inevitably governs a student’s life following high school. Branadh also notes that the contract employs the calculation involving the intelligence and emotional quotient to determine how many classes the prospective AP student will take. “We want to promote the achievement of lofty academic goals. By solidifying a student’s future, we hope to engender certainty surrounding the daunting and convoluted college application process, most notably enabling the creation of extensive, efficient programs that boost goal realization.”

Parents, completely unaware of the change that took place, blindly signed these contracts when they were guaranteed their children’s success in the academic and professional sphere. Their children were invariably subjected to elaborate, unethical testing from the College Board. It is estimated that eighty percent of the children tested score at least 1550 on the SAT, all while mandated to take at least seven AP classes for their four years of high school. “We’re doing something great here,” says Branadh. “By isolating the cream of the crop from the feeble, idiotic masses, we ensure that students that deserve exceptional academic opportunities get them. It’s positively benevolent, and I can’t wait to see how this changes the future.”
