WASHINGTON—Coming off the heels of recent power outages, Puget Sound Energy is responding to criticism by announcing its new plan to reduce the power strain on its generators. In a now-deleted tweet, they stated that their workers will “be playing russian roulette by shooting transformers located in forests.” Puget Sound Energy identified the cause of the strain to be “additional heating turned on in homes,” and stated in replies that “in addition, we will be moving to more fossil-fuel intensive methods of energy generation, to prevent such an issue from happening in the future.”

What does this mean for residents of Washington? According to a statement given from Puget Sound Energy to us, they state that “the revolvers that we will be using will only have two bullets loaded, meaning that more than 65% of the state will have power.” Puget Sound Energy hopes these statements will “quell the rumors and drama that competitors are stirring up.”
