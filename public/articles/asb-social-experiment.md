SAMMAMISHâ€”On January 6th, members of the Skyline High School Associated Student Body (ASB) received a shocking email. Skyline High School officially stated, "Thank you for participating in the Associated Student Body social experiment. You may now return to your normal student functions."

These developments have one question: why did Skyline create the ASB? The statement answers this question: "The Associated Student Body was an experiment to see if and how students would act under the illusions of freedom." Many students were not surprised to learn about the futility of the ASB. "We all knew the truth, some realized they knew, and some did not," stated an anonymous ASB member.

The email further explains the findings of the study conducted by Skyline High School and their conclusions which led them to shut down ASB:

> Throughout the existence of the Associated Student Body, we have noticed that people inside and outside the group consistently criticized all of its actions. We have therefore concluded that any governing body created by those of the lower class is unable to succeed in an environment where organization is a necessity. Disarray and mismanagement permeate all systems that those governed are allowed to choose. Due to our findings, we decided to take back the illusion of control that we have given to allow for a more peaceful school culture. Due to our research, we are canceling all elections. The Associated Student Body, and all other forms of student representation, are permanently closed.

Many people are pushing back upon the messages in this email, and it seems that more and more that a battle of ideologies and the mind may be more necessary than a battle of brawn. Many different groups representing unique ideologies have already formed, and a struggle for power over the control and representation of Skyline Students is imminent.
