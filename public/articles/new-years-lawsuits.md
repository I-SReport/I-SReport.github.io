SAMMAMISH—Amid the hustle and bustle of a year coming to a close, a sudden announcement by the city of Sammamish has people shaken. According to the City Council, all New Year’s parties are illegal, and they will fine those found hosting or attending one for disturbing the peace. With this new shock to the residents of Sammamish, we have investigated what happened, why it is happening, and the potential fallout.

Firstly, what is even happening? At 11:34 PM on December 30th, the City Council of Sammamish officially announced that they shall constitute all New Year’s parties under “Disturbing the peace.” They state that for “the well-being of those living in Sammamish,” they will be “adding new security measures to ensure that everyone is safe” in the transition to 2023.

However, the question that many are asking is: why? We at _The Issaquah-Sammamish Report_ have done some digging, and we believe that we have uncovered the truth behind such sudden and surprising notice. Due to concerns over an increase in lawsuits and crime during New Year’s Eve, they have decided to remove what they consider the source of all their problems: the New Year’s Parties. For corroboration, Sammamish used party expert Maxwell Hunter, a Freshman at the Sexaginta Novem Washington University. Maxwell stated, “I have seen some strange s[tuff] go down at parties.” He also said many other things that we will omit from this article.

The city has not been downright free of criticism, as people question the legality of such an action. Many argue that this violates their First Amendment right to peaceful assembly. Because of this, people have started to file suits against the City of Sammamish for this action. Contrary to the original idea of reducing lawsuits and crime, this action has opened the gateway to an increased amount. With police assigned to cover the anti-party ordinances and criticism coming from every angle, one can only watch the situation unfold.
